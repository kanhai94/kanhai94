# 👋 Hi, I’m @kanhai

👀 I’m interested in building scalable web applications, conversational AI, and automation tools that solve real-world problems.  
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced AI integration, cloud architecture (AWS/GCP), and exploring GenAI for business solutions.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to Node.js, React, chatbots, and AI-powered applications.
